        In this "break out" game,
        <br><br>
        The Main menu (2-3 days)
        <br>
            we have a main menu once the user enter the game, the user can choose game mode or quit game 
        <br>
        <br>
        Sigle player mode		(5 days)
        <br>
            One player moving paddle using array key, there are special item in this mode(like extra life, bomb etc.), destroy all breaks to win, player have three chances, once the ball hits the lower border, one life will be consumed, once the life use up, the game ends, the remaining life number will be shown at left top corner.
        <br>
            There will be 2 level in this mode, player needs to finish the first level to get to level 2, level2 will be harder. 
<br>
        <br>
        Multiple players mode (5 days)      
        <br>
            Two player in this mode, one using the array key, the other will use key ‘A’ and key ‘D’ to move paddle left and right, player can only destroy the break which has the same color as their ball, otherwise it will bound to away and the break will not be destroyed. Each player will have 3 chances, there will be a scoring system in this mode, as two players consumed all there lives or destroy all breaks, the player who has higher score will win(1 point for 1 break).
        Two paddles can bound any balls no matter what color. There will be unbreakable break moving in order left and right in this mode.
        <br>
        <br>
        Items (2 days)
        <br>
        <br>
            Bomb – destroy the breaks nearby and bound the ball
        <br>
            Balls – get extra two balls in game they can be bound by paddle
        <br>
            Extend – the paddle gets longer
        <br>
            Magnetic – the ball will stay on paddle and can be lunch again by click the screen when the ball hits the paddle
